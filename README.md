## BUGS
1. JS for True and False statments
⋅⋅⋅When inspecting my progress in deployed site I have noticed, that my understanding of JS regarding the True and False statments is wrong. I thought that I can create more that one false statment. I have reverted back to student content in JS Essentials and Love Math Project, for better understanding.

Will Implement the changes in HTML and JS structure for Multiple Choice Quiz.
