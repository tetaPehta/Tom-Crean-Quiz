## BUGS
1. JS for True and False statments
⋅⋅⋅When inspecting my progress in deployed site I have noticed, that my understanding of JS regarding the True and False statments is wrong. I thought that I can create more that one false statment. I have reverted back to student content in JS Essentials and Love Math Project, for better understanding.
FIX:
Will Implement the changes in HTML and JS structure for Multiple Choice Quiz.

2. Start Quiz 
⋅⋅⋅When re-building the quiz into correct form, I have merged quiz.html and index.html. Missing the function for start of Quiz.
FIX:
Added the funtion in JS.

4. JSHint
⋅⋅⋅I was not able to fix the JSHint SubmitButton undefined variable. When fixing the code the error did not present in DevTools anymore.

I would like to thank my Mentor, Student care and Tutor support. 
This was a very hard project for me to grasp and I'm aware of its faults and shortcommings.
I will have to devote more time to learn JS.
